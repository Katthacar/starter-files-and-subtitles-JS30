00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,753
You did it. Congratu-freaking-lations.
You killed it. You did all 30 days.

4
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:14,857
Or, you're just watching this video.
For some reason, you want to see

5
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:19,065
what the last video is.
Don't do that. That's a jerk move.

6
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,789
Great job. I'm really proud of you
for doing all 30 days.

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,070
And what I want to leave you with is
sort of some motivation to keep going.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,233
Keep building more stuff. I said a
1,000 things is what you've got to

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:32,890
build. Well, you've got 970 left.
You're just getting started with

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,552
this sort of thing.
So how do you keep it going?

11
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:39,602
For some people, the best way
is to just start teaching others.

12
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:42,935
So help other people out
on this course. Write a blog post.

13
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:46,977
Create a YouTube tutorial, whatever it is.
The way that I got into this stuff is

14
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:49,760
I initially started blogging and
putting up tutorials on YouTube.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,380
And it really helped me solidify my skills
by having to explain it to other people.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,390
So being involved in open-source doesn't
just mean building these frameworks.

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,460
There's a lot of really smart people
that are out there building frameworks and

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,000
libraries and plugins and all that stuff.
But if that's not really where you're at

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,700
right now, where I think you can
contribute is by sharing what you

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,140
know. You just learned a whole
bunch of stuff in this course.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,280
Now turn around, start telling other
people about it. Share it.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,780
Make lots of examples for everybody.
Really, keep it up. Keep building stuff.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,710
Don't let this stop you. You've got 970
more things to build. Thanks a lot.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,024
And I will see you in my next course.
