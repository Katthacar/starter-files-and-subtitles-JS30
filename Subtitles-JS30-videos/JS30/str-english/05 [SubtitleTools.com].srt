00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,950
Today we are going to be making this super
snazzy, what I like to call a flex

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,370
gallery, and I really like this one
because it doesn't include all that much

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,410
JavaScript, and it leans heavily upon
CSS for flexbox, for transitions,

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,890
and for some events that CSS is going to
emit to us. So, this is really cool,

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,780
we're going to lean on CSS quite a bit.
Let's take a look at what we're starting

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,730
with here.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,550
We've got this thing I like to call flex
panels, and if we scroll down to the HTML,

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,570
we've got a div with a class of panels,
and each of these panels is going to be

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,840
called a panel, singular. And then inside
of each of those panels is going to be,

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,490
"Hey," "Let's dance," "Give," "Take,"
"Receive." And these are going to be words

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,320
that, when clicked, they're going to grow
in size, as well as they're going to fall

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,414
from the top and come up from the bottom.

15
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:01,550
So, what I want to start to do is I've
given you some CSS if we open this up in

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,810
the browser now. You see, we start with
some CSS that looks, but it doesn't do

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,230
anything and it actually is not in the
right place. So, I wanted to write the

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,270
actual important part, which is the
flexbox piece with you, as well.

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,170
Let's go up to our CSS, and first of all,
we need to get our panels going side by

20
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,370
side. So if we go the panels div, you do
display: flex on them,

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,300
and by the way, if you are new to flexbox,
I have an entire series at flexbox.io

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,210
that you can visit, and that will guide
you through, similar to this one,

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,950
as well. And when I make those flex
they're going to go side by side by side

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,010
by side, and just stick them all there.

25
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,110
Next, what we need to do is we need to go
to each of the individual panels and tell

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,790
them, "Okay, well this is as much room as
the flex-child needs." It's as big as the

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,560
words are, so this one is the biggest
because it has the biggest word,

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
"experience." But what we want to tell it
to do is that we've got all this extra

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,350
space here, "Why don't you split it
amongst yourselves, children?"

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,670
So we go to our panel and we simply just
say flex: 1, and what that means is that

31
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,690
each of them are going to evenly
distribute the extra space among each

32
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,350
other. And that 1 might not make sense,
but we're going to come back to that in

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,820
just a second, so believe me. There we go.
Okay, so flex of 1 will make them evenly

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,330
distribute the extra space in between
them, so I'm pretty happy with that.

35
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,160
Now, let's move on to each of the panels
and get them visually looking like this,

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,950
where the items are going to be centered
in thirds. So we're going to go to our

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,200
panel here, and first of all, just put a
border: 1px solid red on it,

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,670
just so that we can see what's going on
here. Visually, I think this will really

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,720
help us. So, what's going on here? We've
got each of these panels...oh,

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,240
we don't want to put the border on each of
the panels, sorry. We want to put the

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,350
border on each of the flex items or the
flex children, which is here .panel > *.

42
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,180
Let's put a border there just so we can
see what's going on here.

43
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,900
Okay, so these are our three items. Now, I
want them to...again,

44
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,970
I have all of extra work vertically, how
do I get them to go up and down?

45
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:27,760
So we'll go back to our panel here and
we'll say justify-content: center.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,900
Where does that get us? That gets them
centered left to right. I want to say

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:40,660
align-items: center, which still won't get
us much, but we also need to make this

48
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,230
panel here display: flex. And this is a
really good example of when you will nest

49
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,730
flexbox, because... Let's take a pause for
a second. What is the flex container here?

50
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:59,210
Panels. What is the flex item? Panel. But
we're also going to make panel a flex

51
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:05,310
container. An element in CSS can be both a
flex item, which it is right here,

52
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,350
as well as a flex container, which we are
going to do by making it display: flex.

53
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,840
So by doing that, we stack them left to
right, because that's the default of

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,960
flexbox. We want to change that and we are
going to say flex-direction: column,

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,270
and that will vertically center them in
the middle, but then I also want each of

56
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,800
these items to take up one-third, and
that's just exactly what we've done.

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,901
So let's scroll down to our flex children,
our flex items, and we already put a

58
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:45,930
border on it and here we're going to flex:
1 0 auto, and that will give us these

59
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,340
here. And we want to display: flex on
that, as well, which doesn't do too much

60
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,157
except bring the text to the left. But if
we do justify-content: center and

61
00:04:56,157 --> 00:05:03,370
align-items: center. Now we've got
everything perfectly centered.

62
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,970
This is just a lot of flexbox nested and
nested and nested, which allows us to get

63
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,786
this really cool layout.

64
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:15,330
Okay, so looking pretty good to me so far.
Now, what I want to do is I want to hide

65
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,910
"give," all the way up, and I want to take
"you can," and "today," and "receive," and

66
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,890
hide them all the way down. So what we're
going to use is translateY for that.

67
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:34,940
Let's go down right here. I'm going to say
.panel > *:first-child is going to be

68
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:46,343
transform: translateY(-100%). So each of
the first children are going to be -100%.

69
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:54,817
Okay, so that puts them off-screen, and
then the last-child is going to be 100%.

70
00:05:54,817 --> 00:06:00,351
The idea that we're going for here is that
when you take off this translateY,

71
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,370
it's going to animate itself. See what
it's doing? It's going to transition

72
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,120
itself in and out, in and out, in and out.
And the way that that's going to work is

73
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,800
that when the panel has a class of
open-active, we are going to

74
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,370
translateY(0). And when the panel has a
class of open-active, we are going to take

75
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:33,640
the last-child and translateY(0), as well.
So, what that means is that if we take any

76
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,236
one of these panels, and add a class of
open-active, it will animate itself in

77
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:45,910
take it off, and they go away. So you
can take the border away if you sort of

78
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,390
get it now, where the elements are on the
page. I think we've got a pretty good idea

79
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,810
of visualizing it. So that is
what we've got so far.

80
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,280
The last bit of the puzzle is that when
these panels also have a class of open,

81
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:04,140
what's going to happen is that it needs to
get bigger. You see that the font-size

82
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,510
already changed, but when the panel has a
class of open, scroll down to line 85 or

83
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,860
so, we want to give it a flex of 5. And,
now, what does that mean?

84
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,020
Well, earlier we said a flex of 1
means that each of them are going to

85
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,350
evenly distribute the extra room.
So by giving it a flex of 5,

86
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,370
what that means is that when it has a
class of open, it's going to take 5 times

87
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:34,540
the amount of extra room as the rest of
them, because they are regular flex of 1.

88
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,590
And now we are having a flex of 5, and
that means it should just grow a little

89
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,940
bit bigger. So if I go to one of my panels
here, give it a class of open,

90
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,700
you see that it will animate itself in,
take it away, animate itself out.

91
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,380
I keep saying "animate", I mean
"transition", and why that's happening is

92
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,000
because of this. The panel has a
transition in which we are transitioning

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,959
the font-size over 0.7 seconds, and we're
using these cubic-beziers that we've done

94
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,180
in previous classes. And what that
does is allows us to get this cool,

95
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,352
like, open and close where it goes a
little bit bigger and a little bit smaller

96
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:19,120
than it should, then snaps back into
place. Now that we've got all of the CSS

97
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,890
in place, we really just have to write a
little bit of JavaScript so that when we

98
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,760
click them, it will do that adding and
removing of classes. So first we want to

99
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,410
grab all the panels. Make sure that that's
querySelectorAll, not querySelector,

100
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,820
and that will give us a node list of all
the different ones that we have.

101
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,900
And then we want to write a function
that's going to toggle that class of on or

102
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:48,740
open. So function toggleOpen(). So
this.classList.toggle('open').

103
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,761
And then on each of the panels
we're going to listen for a click.

104
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:57,870
Good. So we're going to take each of the
panels, loop over each one of them,

105
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,710
listen for a click on each one of them,
and then run the toggle function when it

106
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,680
is run. Often I have people ask me, "Why
isn't it toggleOpen like that?" Because

107
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,830
that would run on page load. What we want
to do here is we don't want to run the

108
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,750
function. We just want to give it
reference to the function and say,

109
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,800
"Hey, when someone clicks me, make sure
that you go find this function and run

110
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,740
it." So, let's see where we're at right
now. Oh, we've got a bit of an error here.

111
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,450
Missing a parenthesis on line 133, got it.
Doesn't seem to be working,

112
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:37,150
let's debug this real
quick.console.log('Hello'). There we go.

113
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,110
Hello, hello, hello. Why is it not
toggling the class of open?

114
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh, I see the error here. It's because we
are listening on each individual panel,

115
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,540
singular, not all the panels. Now, when I
click it, it's going to add a class of

116
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,392
open to that specific panel, and
remove that class. Add that class

117
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,559
and remove that class.

118
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:07,540
Now, the second step is that once this has
finished transitioning itself open,

119
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,670
that's when I want to bring in the word
from the top and bring in the word from

120
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,410
the bottom. So, in a previous exercise,
what we did is we listened for the

121
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,950
transition end event, which is exactly
what we're going to do here.

122
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,360
Go down to your panels and just duplicate
that line. We're going to listen for the

123
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,010
transition end event, and we're going to
toggle class of open-active with a

124
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,620
function called toggleActive .
So let's go up here and write that,

125
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,300
and we'll say...normally, what
we'd do is we would say

126
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,570
this.classList.toggle('open-active'),
however, there is going to be multiple

127
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,340
transition end events being fired, and
I'll show you how to figure that out.

128
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,780
We pass the event to this,
comment that out for now, and

129
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:59,502
console.log(e.propertyName).
Let's see what we got here.

130
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,650
So I'm going to click on one of these,
which is going to trigger a transition.

131
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,223
When that transition is finished, it's
going to tell us what transitioned.

132
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, font-size and flex-grow. So two things
are being transitioned here.

133
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,300
Why? Because if you look at our CSS, when
the panel is open, we are transitioning

134
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,490
the flex and the font-size. Both of those
things are getting bigger when the class

135
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,970
of open. And really, we only care about
the flex-grow here, so what we can do is

136
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:36,480
we say if (e.propertyName). And
normally we'd say flex-grow, however,

137
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,320
I did find some bugs in Safari, where in
Safari it's just flex and in the rest of

138
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,840
the browsers it's flex-grow. So even
though if you scroll up here,

139
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,450
we have explicitly stated that we are
working with flex here, some of the

140
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,630
browsers tell it's flex-grow, some of the
them tell it as flex. So what we need to

141
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,300
do is just cover both of our bases, and
rather than checking if it's explicitly

142
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,820
flex-grow, we'll see if it includes the
word flex, and if that is true,

143
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,651
then we will toggle the
class of open-active.

144
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,460
So, again, what's happening here? We are
listening for a click on each panel.

145
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,730
When someone clicks we're going
to open it. That's going to then,

146
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,180
in turn, trigger a CSS open and when
that finishes, the second one,

147
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,910
transition end will fire, and that's when
we're going to toggle open-active.

148
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,980
And then it will just go the other way
when you click it off, as well.

149
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,170
Here we go, open it up and they animate
itself in from the sky and down from the

150
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,420
bottom and then you close it up and
they open themselves up, and close.

151
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,090
So this is pretty cool when you open up
multiple... What I really like about this

152
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,810
is you do not have to specify a
width for this specific gallery,

153
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,140
because if each of them have a flex of 5
they will simply each take a little bit

154
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,200
less of the extra room. If one of them,
it's going to take a lot more.

155
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,229
Hopefully, you liked that.
I'll see you in the next one.
