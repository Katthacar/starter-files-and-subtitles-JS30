00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,070
Everybody, all right, let's get rolling. I
sure hope you're really excited about

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,560
JavaScript 30. Couple of things I need to
talk to you about before we get going.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,710
First, you need to download the starter
files. You can get those in your account

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,360
dashboard, that's how you got to these
videos on javascript30.com... account.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,680
And then, we also need a modern
browser. Chrome, Safari, Firefox.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,600
Any of those are going to be supporting
all of the code that we write in this.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,230
We're going to be writing a lot of ES6
stuff, so make sure it is up-to-date.

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,100
Other than that, there's no compilers
or anything that we need to get

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,230
set up. There's no tooling chain involved.
All you need to do is right-click,

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,400
open in browser for most of these. Couple
of them, like the webcam and the

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,620
microphone, they have security.
You can't open them up on a file,

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,450
you need a local host server. We'll
cover that in those videos,

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,750
not a big deal.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,900
Let's see what else we got here. Couple
things. You're welcome to take the course

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,170
at any pace that you like. The videos
range from 10 minutes up to half an hour,

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,220
and really, the thing I want you to do is
to try to carve out some time every single

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,350
day. You may do more in one day if
you've got a bunch of time available,

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,600
but that sort of habit of, "Oh, I've got
lunch," or, "I've got 20 minutes," "I've

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,650
got half an hour here," or "I'm on the
subway, I should watch a video really

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,940
quickly," that's the habit that I want you
to get into, where you can just tackle

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,270
something and finish it within
an hour or so, or half an hour,

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,860
depending on how long the actual video is.

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,110
Second, people learn in different ways, so
there's three major ways that you might

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,810
want to watch these videos. First, you
might just want to watch them entirely and

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,990
then try to build the things that were
done. Some people prefer to just sit back,

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,900
watch it on the subway, something like
that. Other people like to see what we're

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,670
going to build, pause it, and then try to
build what we are without seeing the video

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,870
at all, and then going back to the video
if they need help or seeing how I've done

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,650
it. And then third, other people,
and this is how I like to learn,

32
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,530
I like to build at the same time
as we are going through a video.

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,420
So we build a little piece,
pause it, try to build it yourself,

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,580
try to do it at the same pace that I'm
doing it. Figure out what way that you

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,539
learn best, because that's
really going to help you out.

36
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:22,090
Second, there are 1001 ways to complete
these. The way I do it is not necessarily

37
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,010
the best way, it's just one way. So if
you come about it a different way,

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,790
totally fine. Don't worry about it. I've
intentionally stayed away from...what?

39
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,010
Design patterns, classes, closures, of
course, any type of framework.

40
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,590
These things are really good, but I just
want to stay away from any opinionated

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,760
stuff like that and really just get down
to understanding what is going on.

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,940
You're welcome to implement it in
any which way that you want.

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,070
Third, don't reach for jQuery,
Lodash, Underscore, boppity boop.

44
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,640
Any framework that you're
used to, even though you think,

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,500
"Oh, Lodash has a handy little method
on it." Those things are great,

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,050
but everything in this course can
be done with just plain JavaScript.

47
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,160
Nothing else is needed for that.

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Finally, grab a friend, accountabilibuddy,
someone who you can do this course with.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,870
It's going to be helpful if you have a
friend you can bounce questions off,

50
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,940
chat about what's going on in
the course, all that good stuff.

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,930
If you don't have a friend, you don't have
someone close to you or someone online

52
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,210
that you can chat with, go on Twitter and
#javascript30. Ask for someone that is

53
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,720
willing sort of team up with you. I think
that you'll get the most out of this

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,360
course if you have a friend that's going
to be doing it. People who have taken one

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,950
of my paid premium courses before,
we have a Slack chat for you.

56
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,470
You can join in on that. Other than
that, that's it. Go hit the videos,

57
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,320
enjoy day one.
