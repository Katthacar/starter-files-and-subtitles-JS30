00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:10,130
Today we are going to be taking two of the
things that we've done in the past,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,630
which is working with mouse move events
and second working with HTML5 video.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,320
And we're going to sort of put them
together. We are going to mash them into

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,950
our colab. So this is just an idea that
I've had. I don't know if it's totally a

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,030
great idea but I know that it was a fun
thing to build regardless.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,990
So I run a video site where I've got a lot
of people watching my videos,

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,720
and I'm always thinking about how do I
make the viewing experience a little bit

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,180
better? So one thing that a lot of
developers like to do is they don't watch

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,310
their videos at 1x. They watch them at
like 1.5 or 2 or like they like to speed

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,160
it up and slow it down depending on how
quickly or how boring,

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,200
or how exciting something is, or how
important something is.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,860
So what I really wanted to do here is just
experiment with a new sort of input that

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,910
would control how fast the video goes so
that rather than you having to click up

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,970
and down to change the video speed, you
can sort of just like DJ it here as you're

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,810
watching the video to go slower and
faster. So I'm just going to give you a

18
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:11,615
little play here. And then chipmunk, and
then you slow it down.

19
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:26,157
So you see what's going on here. As I move
this, like the lowest is going to be 0.5x

20
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:31,657
or 0.4x and then the highest is going to
be all the way up to 4x.

21
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:35,020
And then as you mouse over or as you click
and drag, depending on how you like to do

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,110
your interface, we are just changing that
value and then it's indirectly going to be

23
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,270
setting the playback rate on this video.
So let's jump into it.

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,200
This won't be too big of a one. So far
what I've done is I've selected the speed,

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,280
which is the entire white bar here, and
then we have the speed bar which is going

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,270
to be the field in here or with that sort
of blue gradient right here.

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,010
And then I've just got a video sort of
playing here streaming off of Dropbox.

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,860
Hopefully it doesn't get shut down.
So it's a lot of bandwidth.

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,670
And then I've got a video element here,
which is the actual video here.

30
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,230
Now, I'm going to take auto play off just
for our sanity's sake so it doesn't keep

31
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,710
playing every single time. And then what
happens is when you hover over top of this

32
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,000
we are going to change the playback rate
as well as update the actual visual.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,130
So let's do the visual part first and then
we'll work on the playback rate.

34
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,590
So first thing we need to do is take our
speed and add the event listener of mouse

35
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,340
move. And when that happens we'll have a
function. I'm using a proper function here

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,840
because I need this to be equal to the
video itself. Sorry, not the video,

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,060
the actual speed bar when you mouse over
it. And cool. In that function pass

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,280
yourself the event and then let's just
console log the event when you mouse over

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,100
it. Open that sucker up in your browser
and you should see this video that we've

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,990
got going on and our thing. Now when I
start hovering over top of it,

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,560
you will now see all the different events
that we have going on it.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,050
So first of all we need to get where like
this is going to be zero pixels and this

43
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,120
is going to be however high it is. Let's
talk look look look- 410,

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,620
so that's going to be 410
pixels. So how do we get that?

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,510
We'll say cons y is equal to and we'll do
the same thing we did in the last video,

46
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,790
e dot page y and we are going to take the
offset of this, dot offset top.

47
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,980
Why? Because we can't assume that this bar
is going to be at the top of it.

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,480
There might be padding, or merging or
anything or another element in-between it.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,620
So let's console log y, see what we've got
there. There we go.

50
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,990
You see at the top, you're getting zero.
All the way at the bottom we are getting

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,520
around 410. So that's showing us how far
along we are. We want to turn that into a

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,170
percentage. So if this is a 410 pixel, if
I go to 205 pixels, right around here,

53
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:09,000
that should be 50%. Let's say const
percent is equal to let's take y divided

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,260
by this dot offset height. That's a way to
get the height of the actual one that we

55
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,720
have there. So let's console log the
percent. There we go. So that is a one.

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,987
That is zero. And we could bump those up
to get to what we want.

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,250
Then we also need a min and a max because
want this to be 0.4 and this to be 4,

58
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,323
right? So how do we do that? I would say
const min equals 0.4 and const.

59
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:43,400
Max is equal to, I don't know, max is
equal to 4x or whatever you think the

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,120
crazy upper bound. Then what we do is
we'll make a height variable and we're

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,300
going to set that to...the percentage
right now is like 0.99 and we want to turn

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,910
that into 99%. Take our percent variable,
multiply it by a hundred and then we'll

63
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:12,370
wrap that sucker in, I thought, round. And
then add percent to the end and console

64
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,680
log the height. See what we've got here.
All right. So now we actually are getting

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,860
a full percentage that we're looking for
rather than a zero point something

66
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,070
whatever, and then we'll take our bar
which is the speed bar, a bar,

67
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:39,000
that style. The height is equal to height.
Look at this. So so far,

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,570
we've got it up and going. Looks good.
Next thing we need to do is update that

69
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,380
number that's inside of there, and the way
that we do that is we will then calculate

70
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,160
what the playback rate is. Let's say const
playback rate is going to be equal to.

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,630
This is going to be a bit of a weird one
because we don't want the minimum to be

72
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,129
zero and the maximum to be one. That's not
the playback rate. At a 0% height,

73
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:14,940
it should be 0.4x and at a 100% height it
should be 4x. So we sort of need to do a

74
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,010
little bit of math to get that lower and
upper bounds. And the way that you do that

75
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,780
is you take your percent and you multiply
that by the max minus the min plus the

76
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,350
min. And that's sort of how you can offset
your height. We did that in a couple of

77
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,600
videos ago when we were doing the
tech shot at one when you

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,320
needed to hover negative 50 and plus 50,
not 0 to 100. And that's just a neat way

79
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,540
that we can do that.
We have that playback rate and we can take

80
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:48,590
our bar and set the text content to be
that playback rate. See here.

81
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:56,400
So you see it's just like a crazy number.
So we can take that and just run dot two

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,710
fixed on it and just give us two decimal
places. There we go and then you can tack

83
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,720
on your little x or something onto the
end. So plus x or you could use a template

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,350
string to pop up that in. Looking pretty
snazzy. Last thing we need to do is

85
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,070
actually to take that playback rate that
we have here, console log,

86
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,810
playback rate. Let's see what we got going
on here. Three point five.

87
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,120
We've got to take that value and apply it
to our video. So let's say video dot

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,730
playback rate. And what playback rate is,
take a look at it in our console here,

89
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:41,170
video dot playback rate. One is just
normal speed. So two is equal to,

90
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:51,240
if we were to play it ourselves...ten. The
audio stops at some point.

91
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,470
Four, zero point two. The audio stops at a
very slow amount as well.

92
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:06,770
Like 0.5 is as low as you can get it.
Sounds like I'm just wasted trying to

93
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,820
teach you Flexbox. So video dot playback
rate equals playback rate.

94
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,590
And don't worry about those long
percentage. I know some people are irked

95
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,360
when you have like very long decimal
places but it won't be issue there.

96
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:35,113
Now we'll give it a play. Looks good. Nice
and fast. Slow. Fantastic.

97
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:40,472
So that was kind of cool. We did there is
we both calculated the height as well as

98
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:45,173
attached the playback rate. If you don't
like doing both your presentation and your

99
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,990
functionality in a single function, you
could shell that off to two separate

100
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,860
functions which you would just then call
from your mass move event right here and

101
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,540
then also we could take this function out
and call it handle move and then up here

102
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,784
we'll make a function or replace that
function. We'll call it a handle move.

103
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,340
Then you're just going to hook that up to
mouse move but maybe you'll also want to

104
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,770
hook it up to touch move or any other
event that you wanted. Got that.

105
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,477
Still works wonderfully. Excellent.

106
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,819
So hopefully you enjoyed that
and I will see you tomorrow.
